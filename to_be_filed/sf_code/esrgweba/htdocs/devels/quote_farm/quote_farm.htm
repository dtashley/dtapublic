<ul>
  <li>&quot;Many accident investigations make the same mistake in defining causes.&nbsp;
      They identify the widget that broke or malfunctioned, then locate the person most closely connected with the 
      technical failure: the engineer who miscalculated an analysis, the operator who missed signals or pulled
      the wrong switches, the supervisor who failed to listen, or the manager who made bad decisions&nbsp;
      When causal chains are limited to technical flaws and individual failures, the
      ensuing responses aimed at preventing a similar event in the future are equally limited:
      they aim to fix the technical problem and replace or retrain the individual responsible.&nbsp;
      Such corrections lead to a misguided and potentially disastrous belief that the underlying
      probem has been solved.&quot;--This appeared in a CRM book by Earl L. Wiener, Barbara G. Kanki, Robert L. Helmreich

  <li>&quot;Indeed, it would not be going too far to say that, if a pilot in command were to create an
      atmosphere whereby one of his crew members would be hesitant to comment on any action then he would be failing
      in his duty as pilot in command.&quot;--This appeared in a CRM book by Earl L. Wiener, Barbara G. Kanki, Robert L. Helmreich
      and cites Vette and Macdonald, 1983, need to locate the item.&nbsp; It was in the context of a Royal Commission inquity into
      the 1979 crash of Air New Zealand 901 into Mtr. Erebus, Antarctica, and the statement was made by a

  <li>&quot;People who drink light 'beer' don't like the taste of beer; they just

  <li>&quot;Companies come and go.&nbsp; It's ... part of the genius of
    capitalism.&quot;--U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, in January of 2002, in
response to the bankruptcy filing by Enron</li>
  <li>&quot;I've watched lots of corporations come and go.&nbsp; ... There are
very few companies that have been around for 40 or 50 years.&nbsp; ... Companies
come and go.&nbsp; It's part of the genius of capitalism.&nbsp; People get to make good
decisions or bad decisions, and they get to pay the consequences or to enjoy the
fruits of their decisions.&nbsp; That's the way the system works.&quot;--U.S. Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill, in January of 2002, in response to the bankruptcy filing
by Enron</li>
  <li>&quot;I didn't think this was worthy of me running across the street and
telling the president.&nbsp; I don't go across the street and tell the president every
time somebody calls me.&quot;--U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, in January of
2002, defending his decision not to advise President Bush of Enron's financial
difficulties</li>
  <li>&quot;... unless there's an issue related to the company that reaches
to public responsibility ... in the American capitalist system, companies
are responsible for their actions ...&nbsp; The company had a duty to inform its
shareholders and its employees about things that were going on inside the
company.&nbsp; That's not a federal government responsibility."--U.S. Treasury
Secretary Paul O'Neill, in January of 2002, defending his decision not to take
any federal action to help Enron as its stock price collapsed and it was forced
into bankruptcy</li>

&quot;The debate over computer-assisted proofs is the high-end version of

  <li>&quot;I realize that there are certain hardships that only females must
endure, such as childbirth, waiting in lines for public-restroom stalls, and a
crippling, psychotic obsession with shoe color.&nbsp; Also, females tend to reach

obliterated, the wit is clouded, the reasoner perplexed, and the hero subdued;
where the highest and brightest of mortal beings finds nothing left him but the
consciousness of innocence."--Samuel Johnson</li>

  <li>"Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off."--Colin
Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i>.</li>
  <li>"Being responsible sometimes means pissing people off.&nbsp; Good leadership
involves responsibility to the welfare of the group, which means that some
people will get angry at your actions and decisions.&nbsp; It's inevitable, if you're
honorable.&nbsp; Trying to get everyone to like you is a sign of mediocrity: you'll
avoid the tough decisions, you'll avoid confronting the people who need to be
confronted, and you'll avoid offering differential rewards based on differential
performance because some people might get upset.&nbsp; Ironically, by procrastinating
on the difficult choices, by trying not to get anyone mad, and by treating
everyone equally 'nicely' regardless of their contributions, you'll simply
ensure that the only people you'll wind up angering are the most creative and
productive people in the organization."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint
presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have
stopped leading them. They have either lost confidence that you can help them or
concluded that you do not care. Either case is a failure of leadership."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation,
    <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"The day soldiers stop bringing you their problems is the day you have
stopped leading them.&nbsp; They have either lost confidence that you can help them or
concluded that you do not care.&nbsp; Either case is a failure of leadership.&nbsp;
    If this
were a litmus test, the majority of CEOs would fail.&nbsp; One, they build so many
barriers to upward communication that the very idea of someone lower in the
hierarchy looking up to the leader for help is ludicrous.&nbsp; Two, the corporate
culture they foster often defines asking for help as weakness or failure, so
people cover up their gaps, and the organization suffers accordingly.&nbsp; Real
leaders make themselves accessible and available.&nbsp; They show concern for the
efforts and challenges faced by underlings, even as they demand high standards.&nbsp;
    Accordingly, they are more likely to create an environment where problem
analysis replaces blame."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership
    Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Don't be buffaloed by experts and elites.&nbsp; Experts often possess more
data than judgment. Elites can become so inbred that they produce hemophiliacs
who bleed to death as soon as they are nicked by the real world."--Colin
Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Don't be buffaloed by experts and elites.&nbsp; Experts often possess more
data than judgment.&nbsp; Elites can become so inbred that they produce hemophiliacs
who bleed to death as soon as they are nicked by the real world.&nbsp; Small companies
and start-ups don't have the time for analytically detached experts.&nbsp; They don't
have the money to subsidize lofty elites, either.&nbsp; The president answers the
phone and drives the truck when necessary; everyone on the payroll visibly
produces and contributes to bottom-line results or they're history.&nbsp; But as
companies get bigger, they often forget who 'brought them to the dance':&nbsp; things
like all-hands involvement, egalitarianism, informality, market intimacy,
daring, risk, speed, agility.&nbsp; Policies that emanate from ivory towers often have
an adverse impact on the people out in the field who are fighting the wars or
bringing in the revenues.&nbsp; Real leaders are vigilant, and combative, in the face
of these trends."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership
    Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Don't be afraid to challenge the pros, even in their own backyard."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation,
    <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Don't be afraid to challenge the pros, even in their own backyard.&nbsp; Learn from the pros, observe them, seek them out as mentors and partners.&nbsp;
    But
remember that even the pros may have leveled out in terms of their learning and
skills.&nbsp; Sometimes even the pros can become complacent and lazy.&nbsp; Leadership does
not emerge from blind obedience to anyone.&nbsp; Xerox's Barry Rand was right on
target when he warned his people that if you have a yes-man working for you, one
of you is redundant.&nbsp; Good leadership encourages everyone's evolution."--Colin
Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Never neglect details.&nbsp; When everyone's mind is dulled or distracted
the leader must be doubly vigilant."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint

  <li>"Never neglect details.&nbsp; When everyone's mind is dulled or distracted
the leader must be doubly vigilant."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint
presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>&quot;Strategy equals execution.&nbsp; All the
great ideas and visions in the world are worthless if they can't be implemented
rapidly and efficiently.&nbsp; Good leaders delegate and empower others liberally, but
they pay attention to details, every day.&nbsp; (Think about supreme athletic coaches
like Jimmy Johnson, Pat Riley and Tony La Russa).&nbsp; Bad ones, even those who fancy
themselves as progressive 'visionaries', think they're somehow `above'
operational details.&nbsp; Paradoxically, good leaders understand something else: an
obsessive routine in carrying out the details begets conformity and complacency,
which in turn dulls everyone's mind.&nbsp; That is why even as they pay attention to
details, they continually encourage people to challenge the process.&nbsp; They
implicitly understand the sentiment of CEO leaders like Quad Graphic's Harry
    Quadracchi, Oticon's Lars Kolind and the late Bill McGowan of MCI, who all
independently asserted that the job of a leader is not to be the chief
organizer, but the chief dis-organizer.&quot;--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint
presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"You don't know what you can get away with until you try."--Colin
Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"You don't know what you can get away with until you try.&nbsp; You know the
expression, 'it's easier to get forgiveness than permission'.&nbsp; Well, it's true.
Good leaders don't wait for official blessing to try things out. They're
prudent, not reckless.&nbsp; But they also realize a fact of life in most
organizations: if you ask enough people for permission, you'll inevitably come
up against someone who believes his job is to say 'no'. So the moral is, don't
ask.&nbsp; Less effective middle managers endorsed the sentiment, 'If I haven't
explicitly been told <i>yes</i>, I can't do it', whereas the good ones believed,
`If I haven't explicitly been told <i>no</i>, I can.'&nbsp; There's a world of
difference between these two points of view."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint
presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Keep looking below surface appearances.&nbsp; Don't shrink from doing so
(just) because you might not like what you find."--Colin Powell, from a
PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Keep looking below surface appearances.&nbsp; Don't shrink from doing so
(just) because you might not like what you find. 'If it ain't broke, don't fix
it' is the slogan of the complacent, the arrogant or the scared.&nbsp; It's an excuse
for inaction, a call to non-arms.&nbsp; It's a mind-set that assumes (or hopes) that
today's realities will continue tomorrow in a tidy, linear and predictable
fashion.&nbsp; Pure fantasy.&nbsp; In this sort of culture, you won't find people who
pro-actively take steps to solve problems as they emerge.&nbsp; Here's a little tip:
don't invest in these companies."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint
presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Organization doesn't really accomplish anything.&nbsp; Plans don't
accomplish anything, either.&nbsp; Theories of management don't much matter.&nbsp;
    Endeavors

    Endeavors
succeed or fail because of the people involved.&nbsp; Only by attracting the best
people will you accomplish great deeds.&nbsp; In a brain-based economy, your
best assets are people.&nbsp; We've heard this expression so often that it's become
trite.&nbsp; But how many leaders really 'walk the talk' with this stuff?&nbsp; Too often,
people are assumed to be empty chess pieces to be moved around by grand viziers,
which may explain why so many top managers immerse their calendar time in deal
making, restructuring and the latest management fad.&nbsp; How many immerse themselves
in the goal of creating an environment where the best, the brightest, the most
creative are attracted, retained and, most importantly, unleashed?"--Colin
Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Organization charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation,
    <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Organization charts and fancy titles count for next to nothing.&nbsp; Organization charts are frozen, anachronistic photos in a work place that ought
to be as dynamic as the external environment around you.&nbsp; If people really
followed organization charts, companies would collapse.&nbsp; In well-run
organizations, titles are also pretty meaningless.&nbsp; At best, they advertise some
authority, an official status conferring the ability to give orders and induce
obedience.&nbsp; But titles mean little in terms of real power, which is the capacity
to influence and inspire.&nbsp; Have you ever noticed that people will personally
commit to certain individuals who on paper (or on the organization chart)
possess little authority, but instead possess pizzazz, drive, expertise, and
genuine caring for teammates and products?&nbsp; On the flip side, non-leaders in
management may be formally anointed with all the perks and frills associated
with high positions, but they have little influence on others, apart from their
ability to extract minimal compliance to minimal standards."--Colin Powell,
from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Never let your ego get so close to your position that when your
position goes, your ego goes with it."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint
presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Never let your ego get so close to your position that when your
position goes, your ego goes with it.&nbsp; Too often, change is stifled by people who
cling to familiar turfs and job descriptions.&nbsp; One reason that even large
organizations wither is that managers won't challenge old, comfortable ways of
doing things.&nbsp; But real leaders understand that, nowadays, every one of our jobs
is becoming obsolete.&nbsp; The proper response is to obsolete our activities before
someone else does.&nbsp; Effective leaders create a climate where people's worth is
determined by their willingness to learn new skills and grab new
responsibilities, thus perpetually reinventing their jobs.&nbsp; The most important
question in performance evaluation becomes not, 'How well did you perform your
job since the last time we met?' but, 'How much did you change it?'--Colin
Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Fit no stereotypes.&nbsp; Don't chase the latest management fads.&nbsp; The
situation dictates which approach best accomplishes the team's mission."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation,
    <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Fit no stereotypes.&nbsp; Don't chase the latest management fads.&nbsp; The
situation dictates which approach best accomplishes the team's mission.&nbsp; Flitting
from fad to fad creates team confusion, reduces the leader's credibility, and
drains organizational coffers.&nbsp; Blindly following a particular fad generates
rigidity in thought and action.&nbsp; Sometimes speed to market is more important than
total quality.&nbsp; Sometimes an unapologetic directive is more appropriate than
participatory discussion.&nbsp; Some situations require the leader to hover closely;
others require long, loose leashes.&nbsp; Leaders honor their core values, but they
are flexible in how they execute them.&nbsp; They understand that management
techniques are not magic mantras but simply tools to be reached for at the right
times."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier."--Colin Powell, from a
PowerPoint presentation, <i>A Leadership Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Perpetual optimism is a force multiplier.&nbsp; The ripple effect of a
leader's enthusiasm and optimism is awesome.&nbsp; So is the impact of cynicism and
pessimism.&nbsp; Leaders who whine and blame engender those same behaviors among their
colleagues.&nbsp; I am not talking about stoically accepting organizational stupidity
and performance incompetence with a 'what, me worry?' smile.&nbsp; I am talking about
a gung-ho attitude that says 'we can change things here, we can achieve awesome
goals, we can be the best.'&nbsp; Spare me the grim litany of the 'realist', give me
the unrealistic aspirations of the optimist any day."--Colin Powell, from a

judgment, and most critically, a capacity to anticipate, to see around corners.&nbsp;
    Also look for loyalty, integrity, a high energy drive, a balanced ego, and the
drive to get things done.&nbsp; How often do our recruitment and hiring processes tap
into these attributes?&nbsp; More often than not, we ignore them in favor of length of
resume, degrees and prior titles.&nbsp; A string of job descriptions a recruit held
yesterday seem to be more important than who one is today, what they can
contribute tomorrow, or how well their values mesh with those of the
organization.&nbsp; You can train a bright, willing novice in the fundamentals of your
business fairly readily, but it's a lot harder to train someone to have
integrity, judgment, energy, balance, and the drive to get things done.&nbsp; Good
leaders stack the deck in their favor right in the recruitment phase."--Colin

    Primer</i></li>
  <li>"Great leaders are almost always great simplifiers, who can cut
through argument, debate and doubt, to offer a solution everybody can
understand.&nbsp; Effective leaders understand the KISS principle, Keep It Simple,
Stupid.&nbsp; They articulate vivid, over-arching goals and values, which they use to
drive daily behaviors and choices among competing alternatives.&nbsp; Their visions
and priorities are lean and compelling, not cluttered and buzzword-laden.&nbsp; Their
decisions are crisp and clear, not tentative and ambiguous.&nbsp; They convey an
unwavering firmness and consistency in their actions, aligned with the picture
of the future they paint.&nbsp; The result: clarity of purpose, credibility of
leadership, and integrity in organization."--Colin Powell, from a PowerPoint

facts to be 100 percent sure, because by then it is almost always too late.&nbsp;

  <li>"The commander in the field is always right and the rear echelon is
wrong, unless proved otherwise.&nbsp; Too often, the reverse defines corporate
culture.&nbsp; This is one of the main reasons why leaders like Ken Iverson of Nucor
Steel, Percy Barnevik of Asea Brown Boveri, and Richard Branson of Virgin have
kept their corporate staffs to a bare-bones minimum--how about fewer than 100
central corporate staffers for global $30 billion-plus ABB?&nbsp; Or around 25 and
3 for multi-billion Nucor and Virgin, respectively?&nbsp; Shift the power and the
financial accountability to the folks who are bringing in the beans, not the

  <li>"Command is lonely.&nbsp; Harry Truman was right.&nbsp; Whether you're a CEO or
the temporary head of a project team, the buck stops here.&nbsp; You can encourage
participative management and bottom-up employee involvement, but ultimately the
essence of leadership is the willingness to make the tough, unambiguous choices
that will have an impact on the fate of the organization.&nbsp; I've seen too many
non-leaders flinch from this responsibility.&nbsp; Even as you create an informal,
open, collaborative corporate culture, prepare to be lonely."--Colin Powell,

  <li>&quot;Young men ought to be conceited:&nbsp; but they oughtn't to be
    imbecile."--G.H. Hardy (according to C.P. Snow in the foreword of <i>A
    Mathematician's Apology</i>, said after someone had tried to
convince Hardy that <i>Finnegans Wake</i> was the final literary masterpiece.)</li>
  <li>&quot;Sometimes one has to say difficult things, but one ought to say them
as simply as one knows how.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;Statesmen despise publicists, painters despise art-critics, and
physiologists, physicists, or mathematicians have usually similar feelings;
there is no scorn more profound, or on the whole more justifiable, than that of
the men who make for the men who explain.&nbsp; Exposition, criticism, appreciation,
is work for second-rate minds.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;... There is no one so stupid as to use this sort of language
about mathematics.&nbsp; The mass of mathematical truth is obvious and imposing; its
practical applications, the bridges and the steam engines and dynamos, obtrude
themselves on the dullest imagination.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's
    Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;... Some egotism of this sort is inevitable, and I do not feel
that it really needs justification.&nbsp; Good work is not done by 'humble' men.&nbsp;
    It is
one of the first duties of a professor, for example, in any subject, to
exaggerate a little both the importance of his subject and his own importance in
it.&nbsp; A man who is always asking 'Is what I do worth while?' and 'Am I the right
person to do it?' will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to
    others.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i></li>

  <li>&quot;I do not know an instance of a major mathematical advance initiated
by a man past fifty.&nbsp; If a man of mature age loses interest in and abandons
mathematics, the loss is not likely to be very serious either for mathematics or
for himself.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;It is quite true that most people can do nothing well.&nbsp; If so, it
matters very little what career they choose, and there is really nothing more to
say about it.&nbsp; It is a conclusive reply, but hardly one likely to be made by a
man with any pride; and I may assume that none of us would be content with

  <li>&quot;(Speaking with respect to mathematical achievement) ... What we
do may be small, but it has a certain character of permanence; and to have
produced anything of the slightest permanent interest, whether it be a copy of
verses or a geometrical theorem, is to have done something utterly beyond the
powers of the vast majority of men.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's
    Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;(Speaking with respect to mathematical achievement) ... In these
    days of conflict between ancient and modern studies, there must surely be
    something to be said for a study which did not begin with Pythagoras, and
    will not end with Einstein, but is the oldest and the youngest of
    all.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;A man's first duty, a young man's at any rate, is to be
    ambitious.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;... We must guard against a fallacy common apologists of
science, the fallacy of supposing that the men whose work benefits humanity are
thinking much of that while they do it ... There are many highly
respectable motives that may lead men to prosecute research, but there are three
which are much more important than the rest.&nbsp; The first (without which the rest
must come to nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth.&nbsp;
    Then,
professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one's performance, the shame
that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his work is unworthy of his
talent.&nbsp; Finally, ambition, desire for reputation, and the position, even the
power or the money, which it brings.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's
    Apology</i></li>
  <li>&quot;If intellectual curiosity, professional pride, and ambition are the
dominant incentives to research, then assuredly no one has a fairer chance of
gratifying them then a mathematician.&nbsp; His subject is the most curious of
    all--there is none in which truth plays such odd pranks.&nbsp; It has the most
elaborate and the most fascinating technique, and gives unrivalled openings for
the display of sheer professional skill.&nbsp; Finally, as history proves abundantly,
mathematical achievement, whatever its intrinsic worth, is the most enduring of

which Haros had proved perfectly fourteen years before ... But on the whole

  <li>&quot;There are, to be sure, individuals for whom mathematics exercises a
coldly impersonal attraction ...&nbsp; The aesthetic appeal of mathematics may be

    Hogben, p. 86</li>
  <li>&quot;The seriousness of a theorem, of course, does not <i>lie in</i> its
consequences, which are merely the <i>evidence</i> for its seriousness.&nbsp; Shakespeare had an enormous influence on the development of the English

    <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p.102</li>
  <li>&quot;Some measure of generality must be present in any high-class theorem,
but <i>too much</i> tends inevitably towards insipidity.&nbsp; 'Everything is what it

embody all the pleasant qualities of humanity, but because they are the people
that they are.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 109</li>
  <li>&quot;It seems that mathematical ideas are arranged somehow in strata, the
ideas in each stratum being linked by a complex of relations both among
themselves and with those above and below.&nbsp; The lower the stratum, the deeper
(and in general the more difficult) the idea.&nbsp; Thus the idea of an
    'irrational'
is deeper than that of an integer ...&nbsp; Let us concentrate our attention on
the relations between the integers, or some other group of objects lying in some
particular stratum.&nbsp; Then it may happen that one of these relations can be
comprehended completely, that we can recognize and prove, for example, some
property of the integers, without any knowledge of the contents of lower strata
    ...&nbsp; But there are also many theorems about integers which we cannot
appreciate properly, and still less prove, without digging deeper and
considering what happens below.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, pp. 110-111</li>
  <li>&quot;We do not want many 'variations' in the proof of a mathematical
theorem:&nbsp; 'enumeration of cases', indeed, is one of the duller forms of
mathematical argument.&nbsp; A mathematical proof should resemble a simple and
clear-cut constellation, not a scattered cluster in the Milky Way.&quot;--G.H. Hardy,
    <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 113</li>
  <li>&quot;It is sometimes suggested that pure mathematicians glory in the
uselessness of their work, and make it a boast that it has no practical
applications.&nbsp; The imputation is usually based on an incautious saying attributed
to Gauss, to the effect that, if mathematics is the queen of the sciences, the
the theory of numbers is, because of its supreme uselessness, the queen of
    mathematics--I have never been able to find an exact quotation.&nbsp; I am sure that
Gauss's saying (if indeed it be his) has been rather crudely misinterpreted.&nbsp;
    If
the theory of numbers could be employed for any practical and obviously
honourable purpose, if it could be turned directly to the furtherance of human
happiness of the relief of human suffering, as physiology and even chemistry
can, the surely neither Gauss nor any other mathematician would have been so
foolish as to decry or regret such applications.&nbsp; But science works for evil as
well as for good (and particularly, of course in time of war); and both Gauss
and lesser mathematicians may be justified in rejoicing that there is one
science at any rate, and that their own, whose very remoteness from ordinary
human activities should keep it gentle and clean.&quot;G.H. Hardy, <i>A
    Mathematician's Apology</i>, pp. 120-121</li>
  <li>&quot;I began by saying that there is probably less difference between the
positions of a mathematician and of a physicist than is generally supposed, and
that the most important seems to me to be this, that the mathematician is in
much more direct contact with reality ... mathematical objects are so much
more what they seem.&nbsp; A chair or a star is not in the least like what it seems to
be; the more we think of it, the fuzzier its outlines become in the haze of
sensation which surround it; but '2' or '317' has nothing to do with sensation,
and its properties stand out the more clearly the more closely we scrutinize
    it.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, pp. 128-130</li>
  <li>&quot;It is the dull and elementary parts of applied mathematics, as it is
the dull and elementary parts of pure mathematics, that work for good or ill.&nbsp;
    Time may change all this.&nbsp; No one foresaw the applications of matrices and groups
and other purely mathematical theories to modern physics, and it may be that
some of the 'highbrow' applied mathematics will become 'useful' in as unexpected
a way;&nbsp; but the evidence so far points to the conclusion that, in one subject as
in the other, it is what is commonplace and dull that counts for practical
    life.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p.132. (Written
around 1940, this was an uncanny precursor to nuclear weaponry.)</li>
  <li>&quot;There is one comforting conclusion which is easy for a real
mathematician.&nbsp; Real mathematics has no effects on war.&nbsp; No one has yet discovered
any warlike purpose to be served by the theory of numbers or relativity, and it
seems unlikely that anyone will do so for many years.&nbsp; It is true that there are
branches of applied mathematics, such as ballistics and aerodynamics, which have
been developed deliberately for war and demand a quite elaborate technique: it
is perhaps hard to call them 'trivial', but none of them has any claim to rank
as 'real'.&nbsp; They are indeed repulsively ugly and intolerably dull; even
Littlewood could not make ballistics respectable, and if he could not who
    can?&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 140. (Written
around 1940, this was an uncanny precursor to nuclear weaponry.&nbsp; Also, Snow
writes in the foreword, pp. 39-40, &quot;Hardy's close friends were away at the
war.&nbsp; Littlewood was doing ballistics as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal
Artillery.&nbsp; Owing to his cheerful indifference he had the distinction of
remaining a Second Lieutenant through the four years of the war.&quot;)</li>
  <li>&quot;... there are two sharply contrasted views about modern
scientific war.&nbsp; The first and the most obvious is that the effect of science on
war is merely to magnify its horror, both by increasing the sufferings of the
minority who have to fight and by extending them to other classes.&nbsp; This is the
most natural and the orthodox view.&nbsp; But there is a very different view which
seems also quite tenable, and which has been stated with great force by Haldane
in <i>Callinicus</i>.&nbsp; It can be maintained that modern warfare is <i>less</i>
horrible than the warfare of pre-scientific times;&nbsp; the bombs are probably more
merciful than bayonets;&nbsp; that lachrymatory gas and mustard gas are perhaps the
most humane weapons yet devised by military science;&nbsp; and that the orthodox view
rests solely on loose-thinking sentimentalism.&nbsp; It may also be urged (although
this was not one of Haldane's theses) that the equalization of risks which
science was expected to bring would be in the long run salutary;&nbsp; that a
civilian's wife is not worth more than a soldier's, nor a woman's more than a
man's;&nbsp; that anything is better than the concentration of savagery on one
particular class;&nbsp; and that, in short, the sooner the war comes 'all out' the
    better.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 142</li>
  <li>&quot;When the world is mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an
incomparable anodyne.&nbsp; For mathematics is, of all the arts and sciences, the most
austere and the most remote, and a mathematician should be for all men the one
who can most easily take refuge where, as Bertrand Russell says, 'one at least
of our nobler impulese can best escape from the dreary exile of the actual
world'.&nbsp; It is a pity that is should be necessary to make one very serious
    reservation--he must not be too old.&nbsp; Mathematics is not a contemplative but a
creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the
power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician
rather soon.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 143</li>
  <li>&quot;I cannot remember ever having wanted to be anything but a
mathematician.&nbsp; I suppose that it was always clear that my specific abilities lay
that way, and it never occurred to me to question the verdict of my elders.&nbsp;
    I do
not remember having felt, as a boy, any <i>passion</i> for mathematics, and such
notions as I may have had of the career of a mathematician were far from noble.&nbsp;
    I thought of mathematics in terms of examinations and scholarships:&nbsp; I wanted to
beat other boys, and this seemed to be the way in which I could do so most
    decisively.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 144</li>
  <li>&quot;I had of course found at school, as every future mathematician does,
that I could often do things much better than my teachers; and even at Cambridge
I found, though naturally much less frequently, that I could sometimes do things
better than the College lecturers.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's
    Apology</i>, p. 146-147</li>
  <li>&quot;It is plain now that my life, for what it is worth, is finished, and
that nothing I can do can perceptibly increase or diminish its value.&nbsp; It is very
difficult to be dispassionate, but I count it as a 'success';&nbsp; I have had more
reward and not less than was due to a man of my particular grade of ability.&nbsp;
    I have held a series of comfortable and 'dignified' positions.&nbsp; I have had very
little trouble with the duller routine of universities.&nbsp; I hate 'teaching', and
have had to do very little, such teaching as I have done having been almost
entirely supervision of research;&nbsp; I love lecturing, and have lectured a great
deal to extremely able classes;&nbsp; and I have always had plenty of leisure for the
researches which have been the one great permanent happiness of my life.&nbsp; I have
found it easy to work with others, and have collaborated on a large scale with
two exceptional mathematicians; and this has enabled me to add to mathematics a
good deal more than I could reasonably have expected.&nbsp; I have had my
disappointments, like any other mathematician, but none of them has been too
serious or has made me particularly unhappy.&nbsp; If I had been offered a life
neither better nor worse when I was twenty, I would have accepted without
    hesitation.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's Apology</i>, p. 149</li>
  <li>&quot;My choice was right, then, if what I wanted was a reasonably
comfortable and happy life.&nbsp; But solicitors and stockbrokers and bookmakers often
lead comfortable and happy lives, and it is very difficult to see how the world
is richer for their existence.&nbsp; Is there any sense in which I can claim that my
life has been less futile than theirs?&nbsp; It seems to me again that there is only
one possible answer: yes, perhaps, but, if so, for one reason only.&nbsp; I have never
done anything 'useful'.&nbsp; No discovery of mine has made, or is likely to make,
directly or indirectly, for good or ill, the least difference to the amenity of
the world.&nbsp; I have helped to train other mathematicians, but mathematicians of
the same kind as myself, and their work has been, so far at any rate as I have
helped them to it, as useless as my own.&nbsp; Judged by all practical standards, the
value of my mathematical life is nil; and outside mathematics it is trivial
anyhow.&nbsp; I have just one chance of escaping a verdict of complete triviality,
that I may be judged to have created something worth creating.&nbsp; And that I have
created something is undeniable: the question is about its value.&nbsp; The case for
my life, then, or for that of any one else who has been a mathematician in the
same sense in which I have been one, is this: that I have added something to
knowledge, and helped others to add more; and that these somethings have a value
which differs in degree only, and not in kind, from that of the creations of the
great mathematicians, or of any of the other artists, great or small, who have
left some kind of memorial behind them.&quot;--G.H. Hardy, <i>A Mathematician's
    Apology</i>, pp. 150-151</li>

  <li>&quot;Look again at that dot.&nbsp; That's here.&nbsp; That's home.&nbsp; That's us.&nbsp;
    On it
everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human
being who ever was, lived out their lives.&nbsp; The aggregate of our joy and
suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines,
every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother
and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every
corrupt politician, every 'superstar', every 'supreme leader', every saint and
sinner in the history of our species lived here--on a mote of dust suspended in
a sunbeam.&quot;--Carl Sagan, precise source unknown</li>
  <li>&quot;The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.&nbsp; Think of the rivers
of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and
triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.&nbsp; Think
of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent
their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent
their hatreds.&quot;--Carl Sagan, precise source unknown</li>
  <li>&quot;Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some
    privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.&nbsp;
    Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.&nbsp; In our
obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from
elsewhere to save us from ourselves.&quot;--Carl Sagan, precise source unknown</li>
  <li>&quot;The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.&nbsp; There is nowhere
else, at least not in the near future, to which our species could migrate.&nbsp;
    Visit, yes.&nbsp; Settle, not yet.&nbsp; Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we
make our stand.&quot;--Carl Sagan, precise source unknown</li>
  <li>&quot;It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
experience.&nbsp; There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.&nbsp; To me, it underscores our
responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish
the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known."--Carl Sagan, <i>Pale

  <li>&quot;Can
someone give a hint on how many lines of code a programmer can produce a day?&nbsp;
    I
know that this depends on the language, etc., but I'm most interested in C/C++.&nbsp;
    On my most productive single day, the program I was working on had 3000 fewer
lines than it did when I started.&quot;--quote which Dan Parks got from a newsgroup, source

  <li>&quot;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved
from a simple system that worked ... A complex system designed from scratch
never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.&nbsp; You have to start over,
beginning with a working simple system.&quot;--Grady Booch</li>
  <li>&quot;The trouble with many Software Engineering principles and methodologies
is they don't concentrate on doing the time-consuming, difficult and error-prone
process of getting the system requirements straightened out--instead relying on
    'well defined procedures' which are easy to specify, but don't help
much when trying to understand what a system needs to accomplish--or more
importantly, coaxing a non-technical project lead to devote his/her resources to
spending time with the users.&quot;--Unknown</li>
  <li>&quot;I've been developing systems of varying complexity since 1990 and have yet to
hear of a software engineering methodology which improves significantly on the
basic principle of studying what the user needs, organizing it, adapting to
change and implementing--usually in combination.&nbsp; UML isn't much more than a
notational change to the entity/relationship/&quot;flowcharting&quot;/whatever we did a decade ago.&nbsp;

CASE tools have marginally improved since, but not markedly.&nbsp; But thats only my
take on it ... no doubt I'm part of the problem.--Unknown</li>
  <li>&quot;Frankly, I figure the SEI rating stuff has a half-life of about 4 years, its
got 5 or 6 more before it falls into the dustbin of antiquity.&nbsp; But, its in good
company with TQM and all the other philosophies which aren't dealing with the
hard problems.--<i>Possibly</i> from a book by Steve McConnell entitled <i>After
The Gold Rush</i>, but probably from a review of the book.&nbsp; This quote forwarded to

  <li>&quot;It should be noted that no ethically-trained software engineer would

  <li>&quot;There are two ways of constructing a software design:&nbsp; One way is to
