A substantial benefit of \emph{The MIT License} is that it does not require manufacturers
of embedded system products to provide notice to customers that open-source
software is incorporated into the product.\footnote{At least that is \emph{my} interpretation
of the license.  The \emph{Open Source Initiative} website suggests that \emph{software} means
the source code, and that binaries are a separate matter.  I'm willing to discuss
this interpretation and to move to an even less restrictive license if there are
concerns about a manufacturer's obligations.}  A typical consumer has no interest in the
origin of the software in a product he purchases.  A typical manufacturer does not want
the burden of providing notice.

\section{Choice of \emph{\LaTeX{}}}
\label{ciov2:sclt0}

\LaTeX{} is an uncommon word processing tool.\footnote{The distribution I use is
\index{MikTeX@\emph{MikTeX}}\emph{MikTeX}.}  Its key features are:

\begin{itemize}
   \item Text source files are prepared, and then compiled to graphical output (in this respect,
         it resembles a programming language compiler).
   \item Files containing figures are usually in individual files, separate from the source
         files.  The source files reference the files containing the figures.
   \item The references that have to be resolved as part of compilation (table of contents
         entries, index entries, cross-references) are stored in auxiliary text files that are
         generated and
         used by the compilation process.  (Simple tools can be written
         to use this information.)
\end{itemize}

\LaTeX{} was chosen for this document for these reasons:

\begin{itemize}
   \item \LaTeX{} source files (plain text) are very compatible with \emph{git}.
         Difference reports are meaning and can be understood for review.
   \item Figures are stored as separate \index{eps file@\emph{.eps} file}\emph{.eps} files.
         These change infrequently and allow \emph{git} to deal with typical document changes
         (changes to plain text files only) efficiently.  (This is unlike a typical
         \index{Microsoft Word@\emph{Microsoft Word}}\emph{Microsoft Word} document, where
         \emph{git} is forced to treat the document as binary and store a new copy of the entire
         document when any minor change is made.)
   \item By processing the auxiliary text files that are produced during 
         \LaTeX{} compilation, this document and the companion book may contain section
         and page references to each other.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tools, Tool Collections, Tool Aggregations, and Components}
\label{ciov2:sote0:ssup0}

As used in this document:

\begin{itemize}
   \item A \index{tool!definition}\emph{tool} is a software component
         or software program that performs a task or a set of closely related tasks, and is
         typically packaged as one executable or one script.
         (For example, a tool that performs arithmetic on large integers might add, subtract, multiply,
         divide large integers---tasks which are closely related.)
   \item A \index{tool collection!definition}\emph{tool collection} is a set
         of tools that are separate scripts or executables, but distributed together.
   \item A \index{tool aggregation!definition}\emph{tool aggregation} is a single executable or
         script that incorporates two or more tools, and where the functionality of the
         incorporated tools is identified distinctly.
   \item A \index{component!defined}\emph{component} is a software building block that
         is used in the construction of other software. 
\end{itemize}
