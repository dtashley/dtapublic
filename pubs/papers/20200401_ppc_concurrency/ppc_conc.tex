\begin{abstract}
This document describes common causes of intermittent software defects
in embedded software (some of which are generic to all microcontroller
software, and some of which require specific hardware features).  Technical
background about these causes is also provided.

Information about architectural features of the 
Power Architecture\textsuperscript{\textregistered} family of processors is
provided, especially as it relates to intermittent software defects and how
to avoid producing software containing these intermittent software defects.

Information about NXP\textsuperscript{\textregistered} single-core and
multi-core microcontrollers that incorporate
Power Architecture\textsuperscript{\textregistered} processor cores is provided,
especially as it relates to intermittent software defects and how to avoid
producing software containing these intermittent defects.

Information about C/C++ compilers and the 
Green Hills Software\textsuperscript{\textregistered} C/C++ compilers
is provided,
especially as it relates to intermittent software defects and how to avoid
producing software containing these intermittent defects.
